# tech-docs ðŸ“šâœ¨

My personal collection of technical documentation that Iâ€™ve written, covering everything Iâ€™ve learned along the way. I do my best to keep it updated regularly with new topics!

You can visit [the tech-docs website](https://slynj.github.io/tech-docs/) to view the documentations!
