# Welcome to Tech-Docs!

## About 
This is my collection of documentations where I’ve gathered everything I’ve learned so far. It’s a mix of things I’ve explored, built, and found useful along the way. I'll try to keep it updated regularly with new topics and concepts :> 
<br> <br>
Most of the documents were originally written as a reference for myself, so I can revisit and recall things when needed. Completely open to suggestions and improvements!
